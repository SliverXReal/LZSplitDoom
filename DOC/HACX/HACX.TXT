HACX Twitch 'N' Kill v1.2 Improved Edition (2021).
By OV3RDR1VE
 
This is my custom symbiosis of HACX v1.0 Commercial CD Release and HACX v1.2.
The goal of this project was to bring the missing elements from HACX v1.0 Commercial CD Release to HACX v1.2 and therefore create a proper, complete version with available genuine assets, eliminate almost every single bug and enhance/tweak some aspects. I enjoyed doing playtesting through all the 22 levels of this game and I felt that it didn't get the attention it actually deserves. Based on my research of majority of the details I composed this Improved Edition which definitely gives a huge credit to the product, the potential of which was not fully revealed under difficult circumstances it encountered while being released back in 1997.
The changelog is as follows:
