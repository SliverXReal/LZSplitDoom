What it is:
-----------
At its core, the mod contains Freedoom: Phase 1's maps using Doom's assets as much as possible.
Certain levels contain references to textures that don't exist in Doom, so they will still show
as their Freedoom forms, but this is fairly minimal. All other assets will be pulled from a user
provided doom.wad.

In addition, Cheello's Voxel Doom mod along with pkweapports and better dynamic lights are included.
